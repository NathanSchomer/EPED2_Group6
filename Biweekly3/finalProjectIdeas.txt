These are just a few ideas I had for the final project with short descriptions of each. Please feel
free to add any you guys think of.

Final Project Ideas:

1. Robot Control via ROS
	-this setup would invovle publishing accelerometer data to a ROS topic via the Robot Control Toolbox
	-There are two main issues with this idea. The first is that the Robot Control Toolbox costs money beyond the free
		30-day trial. The second is that the hardware setup may become more cumberson than the MATLAB code itself.

2. Sleep Analysis
	-this project would involve attaching the accelerometer to an arm band to record data through the night. The user 
		could use the GUI to view their sleep cycles, set an alarm to wake them up after a certain number of 
		REM cycles, and track the length of sleep over multiple nights.
	-The only real issue with this idea is that sleep analysis via accelerometer isn't very accurate. However, I don't 
		think it actually matters if it's accurate or not, as long as the GUI looks good and it works the same as
		we document it in the code and final presentation.
	-The great thing about this proejct is how [potentially] easy it is. The calculations would involve pretty much just
		adding the magnitudes from the X, Y & Z axes and then plotting them after some basic filtering.
	-Also, I have a sewing machine for us to make an arm band for the accelerometer
	-Testing would involve sleeping... what could be better than that??
