Instructions for using Git:

Once changes are made to local repository:
 
  1. git add <filename(s)>
	- propose changes by "add"ing them to the Index
	- Ex: "git add myFile1.py myFile2.py myFile3.py"

  2. git commit -m "Add brief message about what you changed/ added."
	- this will commit the changes to the Head

  3. git push origin master
	- use this EXACT command to push the proposed changes to the master repository (in the cloud)



To check for Changes to Master:

  1. git pull
	- use this EXACT command to pull any changes other contributers may have made
	- check out http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/ to learn how to merge repositories
